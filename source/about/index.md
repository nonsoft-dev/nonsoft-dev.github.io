# About me

I'm nonsoft - an anonymous game developer and programmer.

I'm in the process of publishing an idle game. You'll find more information about it in this website.

## Social

For now, I only use [Github](https://github.com/nonsoft-dev). Maybe will have a discord channel in the future.

## Contact

If you want to cooperate or have any ideas, send me an at: nonsoft.dev@gmail.com
